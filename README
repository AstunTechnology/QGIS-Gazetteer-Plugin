# QGIS Gazetteer Plugin

Adds a gazetteer search panel to QGIS 1.8 / 2.0 which by default searches GeoNames and Yahoo (place search) plus an [Astun Technology](http://astuntechnology.com) iShare address search.

All searches are performed via a web service call. The available searches can be configured in `gazetteers/config.ini`, each gazetteer requires a corresponding set of config / logic in it's own python file in `gazetters`.

The [qgis-gazetteer-search](https://github.com/mixedbredie/qgis-gazetteer-search) repository by [mixedbredie](https://github.com/mixedbredie) is a good choice if you'd like to roll your own search webservice such as one based on the LLPG (Local Land and Property Gazetteer) or LSG (Local Street Gazetteer) used in Great Britain.
