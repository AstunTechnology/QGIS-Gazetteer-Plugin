# QGIS Gazetteer Plugin

Adds a gazetteer search panel to QGIS 1.8 / 2.0 which by default searches [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/) and [OSM Nominatim](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) plus an [Astun Technology](http://astuntechnology.com) iShare address search.

## Available Gazetteers

All searches are performed via a web service call. The available searches can be configured in `gazetteers/config.ini`, each gazetteer requires a corresponding set of config / logic in it's own python file in `gazetteers`.

The [qgis-gazetteer-search](https://github.com/mixedbredie/qgis-gazetteer-search) repository by [mixedbredie](https://github.com/mixedbredie) is a good choice if you'd like to roll your own search webservice such as one based on the LLPG (Local Land and Property Gazetteer) or LSG (Local Street Gazetteer) used in Great Britain.

## Installation

### Manual

The plugin files need to live in a directory called `gazetteersearch` inside the QGIS Python plugins directory.

*Windows note:* The QGIS plugin directory should be under `C:\Documents and Settings\<Username>\.qgis2\python\plugins\` (Windows XP) or `C:\Users\<Username>\.qgis2\python\plugins\` (Windows +7).

*QGIS 1.8 note:* QGIS 1.8 stores it config under a `.qgis` directory.

Once the plugin is loaded in the python directory, it can be enabled from the list of installed plugins in QGIS and then accessed from the plugins menu.

### Using git

If you are using `git` then simply clone the repository into your QGIS python plugins directory:

    cd ~/.qgis2/python/plugins/
    git clone https://github.com/AstunTechnology/QGIS-Gazetteer-Plugin.git gazetteersearch

## Configuration

### Astun Technology

* Uncomment the Astun Technology Gazetteer from `gazetteers\config.ini`
* In `gazetteers\astun.py` edit the URL (line 4) to point at your iShare Maps getdata.aspx URL. This is generally your standard iShare Web URL, ending in getdata.aspx
* Note that installations requiring credentials for access (such as iShareGIS) are not currently compatible with the Gazetteer Plugin.
